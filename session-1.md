# Session 1: build the research wiki

Wednesday. You're turning your challenge into evidence: real sources, real
figures, and a problem statement your team can defend out loud.

[Back to the front page](README.md) · [Session 2](session-2.md)

## Open it

1. Go to **[claude.ai/code](https://claude.ai/code)** and sign in with your Claude
   account
2. **Check the network setting first.** Above the message box there's a cloud
   button. It should already say **Full network access**. If it says anything
   else, click it and change it. Claude cannot read a single web page without
   this, and it fails quietly: searches come back, then nothing loads
3. Click **+ Select repo...**
4. In the dropdown that opens, click **Connect to GitHub**
5. GitHub asks whether Claude can access your account. Press the green
   **Authorize** button
6. Back in the repo list, search for `2026-sdg-13-test` and click
   **LMU-GLP/2026-sdg-13-test**

**Repo not in the list?** You haven't accepted the invitation to it yet. Open
**[github.com/LMU-GLP/2026-sdg-13-test/invitations](https://github.com/LMU-GLP/2026-sdg-13-test/invitations)**
and press **Accept invitation**. Then reload Claude Code and go back to step 3.


## 1. Start together

One person drives. The whole team answers out loud. This runs once per team,
because it decides your angle and builds the structure everyone else works
inside.

```
We're the SDG 13 (Climate Action (facilitator test repo, not a team)) team.
Our challenge: "How might we help a neighborhood stay safe during extreme
heat?" We can focus on Los Angeles, South Korea, or any other part of the
world.

Read this gist and set up this repo as an LLM wiki for that challenge:
https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f
But before you build anything, interview us for context. Ask one question at a
time, give us multiple-choice options, and keep going until you know enough
about our challenge, our candidate regions, and what we need to research.
```

**Then merge it right away**, before anyone splits up. Your teammates' sessions
start from `main`, so until you merge, they'll open an empty repo and build a
second, different wiki.

## 2. Split up, one source each

Everyone now runs their own session. If you opened this repo before the driver
merged, run this first:

```
Pull the latest from main so I have the wiki the team just merged.
```

**Claim a different source from this list.** Two are already in `sources/`, so
these are the ones still missing:

- UN targets for your goal: `sdgs.un.org/goals/goal13`
- One dataset (UN Stats, World Bank, or a local source)
- A news story about the problem in your first region
- A news story about the problem in your second region
- One product or program already trying to solve this

**Then run this prompt**, swapping `[your source]` and `[your region]` for the
one you claimed:

```
Find a source on [your source] in [your region]. Create a markdown file in
sources/ with the page title, the URL, today's date, the key facts and figures
with short direct quotes, and a two-sentence summary. Don't edit the wiki pages
yet.
```

Watch what Claude does while it works: it searches, opens a page, then writes a
file. Those actions are where your citations come from.

Write down the numbers that matter and quote them exactly. Don't copy whole
articles into the repo. A judge wants the figure and the source, not the page.

## Saving and merging, any time

You never type git commands. To save:

```
Commit our work with a note about what we did, and push it.
```

To publish, ask Claude to open the pull request:

```
Create a pull request for our work and give me the link.
```

Open that link, press **Merge pull request**, then **Confirm merge**.

No link? Go to [your repo](https://github.com/LMU-GLP/2026-sdg-13-test) → the
**Pull requests** tab → the green **Compare & pull request** button on the
yellow banner.

Claude can open a pull request. Only you can merge it.


You'll do this twice: once right after step 1, so your teammates start from the
wiki instead of an empty repo, and again once everyone's sources are in.

## 3. Finish together

One person drives again, and everyone watches the pages connect to each other.

```
Ingest everything in sources/ and update the wiki.
```

## 4. Read what you built

Merge again, then look at what's actually on `main`:

**[github.com/LMU-GLP/2026-sdg-13-test](https://github.com/LMU-GLP/2026-sdg-13-test)**

You should see `sources/` holding the raw pages, `wiki/` holding what Claude
wrote from them, and `CLAUDE.md` holding the rules. Click into `wiki/` and read
the pages as a team.

If you only see the README, your work is still on a draft branch. Go back and
merge.

This is the first time you see the whole thing instead of one answer at a time.
It's also where you notice if your evidence is thinner than you thought. If a
page makes a claim with no citation behind it, treat it as a placeholder. Never
put it in your pitch.

## 5. Decide, and write it down

This is the hard question, and it's the same move as step 1. Claude asks, you
decide.

```
Help me draft a problem statement from our wiki. Ask me one question at a time.
```

Answer out loud, as a team. The questions come from your own evidence, so this
is where you find out which region you can actually defend and who your project
is really for. Argue about it. That argument is the work.

When you're happy with it:

```
Save it to wiki/problem-statement.md, commit, and push.
```

Then read it out loud one more time. If any team member can't defend a sentence
in it, that sentence needs a better source. Merge it.

## 6. If you finish early

```
Find contradictions and gaps in our wiki, and tell us what we're missing.
```

## Before you leave

- Your work is **merged to `main`** and you can see it on GitHub
- `wiki/problem-statement.md` exists, with at least two citations
- A region you picked on purpose and can defend out loud
- No uncited claims in anything you plan to pitch
