# SDG 13: Climate Action (facilitator test repo, not a team) — GLP 2026

**Your challenge:** How might we help a neighborhood stay safe during extreme heat?

**Your region is open.** Los Angeles, South Korea, or any other part of the
world. Research two before you commit to one.

Every prompt you need is on this page, in order. Each one has a copy button in
its top-right corner, so you never have to select text by hand.

## What Claude Code is

You've used AI that chats with you. This one works on files instead.

Claude Code reads and writes the files in this repo, runs commands, and shows
you every action it takes. When it finds a source, it writes a real file. When
you tell it to save your work, you watch the git commands go by. Nothing
disappears when you close the tab, because it all lives in this repo, and the
repo belongs to your team.

That's the difference that matters on Monday: a chat gives you an answer, and
this gives you evidence you can point at.

## Open it

1. Go to **[claude.ai/code](https://claude.ai/code)** and sign in with your Claude account
2. Just above the message box there's a row with two buttons. Click the cloud
   one that says **Default**, hover **Default** in the menu, click the gear,
   set **Network access** to **Full**, and save. Do this before you send
   anything, or Claude won't be able to read any web page
3. In that same row, click **+ Select repo...** and choose
   **LMU-GLP/2026-sdg-13-test**
4. If it isn't in the list, you haven't accepted the GitHub invitation yet.
   Open [github.com/notifications](https://github.com/notifications), accept
   the invite, then reload Claude Code

## 1. Start together

One person drives. The whole team answers out loud. This runs once per team,
because it decides your angle and builds the structure everyone else works
inside.

```
We're the SDG 13 (Climate Action (facilitator test repo, not a team)) team.
Our challenge: "How might we help a neighborhood stay safe during extreme
heat?" We can focus on Los Angeles, South Korea, or any other part of the
world.

Read this gist and set up this repo as an LLM wiki for that challenge:
https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f
But before you build anything, interview us for context. Ask one question at a
time, give us multiple-choice options, and keep going until you know enough
about our challenge, our candidate regions, and what we need to research.
```

**Then merge it right away** (step 4 below), before anyone splits up. Your
teammates' sessions start from `main`, so until you merge, they'll open an
empty repo and build a second, different wiki.

## 2. Split up, one source each

Everyone now runs their own session.

If you opened this repo in Claude Code before the driver merged, your session
is working from the old, empty copy. Run this first:

```
Pull the latest from main so I have the wiki the team just merged.
```

**Claim a different source from this list.** These five are the minimum. Cover
them between you, then add as many more from any category as you have time for:

- UN targets for your goal: `sdgs.un.org/goals/goal13`
- One dataset (UN Stats, World Bank, or a local source)
- A news story about the problem in your first region
- A news story about the problem in your second region
- One product or program already trying to solve this

**Then run this prompt**, swapping `[your source]` and `[your region]` for the
one you claimed:

```
Find a source on [your source] in [your region]. Create a markdown file in
sources/ with the page title, the URL, today's date, the key facts and figures
with short direct quotes, and a two-sentence summary. Don't edit index.md or
the wiki pages yet.
```

Watch what Claude does while it works: it searches, opens a page, then writes a
file. Those actions are where your citations come from.

Write down the numbers that matter and quote them exactly. Don't copy whole
articles into the repo. A judge wants the figure and the source, not the page.

## 3. Save your work

You never type git commands. Ask:

```
Commit our work with a note about what we did, and push it.
```

Claude saves to your own draft branch and shows you each command it ran.

## 4. Merge, so your work counts

Claude has been saving to a **draft branch**: your own private copy of the
team's work. Nobody else can see it, and none of it counts yet.

To publish it you open a **pull request**, usually shortened to **PR**. That's
GitHub's word for a proposal. It says: here are my changes, should we add them
to the team's real work? Somebody looks at it, then merges it. At a company a
teammate reviews it first. Today your team is the reviewer.

Two clicks, in two different places.

**In Claude Code:** look just above the message box for the bar with your branch
name and a green count like `+482 -0`. Click it to see everything Claude
changed, then select **Create PR**.

**Then on GitHub:** Claude gives you a link to the PR. Open it and press **Merge
pull request**, then **Confirm merge**.

Lost the link? Go to
[your repo](https://github.com/LMU-GLP/2026-sdg-13-test) and click the **Pull
requests** tab at the top. Yours will be in the list.

There is no merge button inside Claude Code. Creating the PR only proposes the
change. Merging is what puts it on `main`.

You'll do this twice: once right after step 1, so your teammates start from the
wiki instead of an empty repo, and again once everyone's sources are in.

If GitHub says there's a conflict, that's normal when several people work at
once. Ask:

```
Merge main into our branch and resolve the conflicts.
```

## 5. Finish together

One person drives again, and everyone watches the pages connect to each other.

```
Ingest everything in sources/ and update the wiki.
```

## 6. Read what you built

Merge again, then look at what's actually on `main`:

**[github.com/LMU-GLP/2026-sdg-13-test](https://github.com/LMU-GLP/2026-sdg-13-test)**

You should see the three layers from this morning: `sources/` holding the raw
pages, `wiki/` holding what Claude wrote from them, and `CLAUDE.md` holding the
rules. Click into `wiki/` and read the pages as a team.

If you only see this README, your work is still sitting on a draft branch. Go
back to step 4 and merge.

This is the first time you see the whole thing instead of one answer at a
time. It's also where you notice if your evidence is thinner than you thought.
If a page makes a claim with no citation behind it, treat it as a placeholder.
Never put it in your pitch.

## 7. Decide, and write it down

This is the hard question, and it's the same move as step 1. Claude asks, you
decide.

```
Help me draft a problem statement from our wiki. Ask me one question at a time.
```

Answer out loud, as a team. The questions come from your own evidence, so this
is where you find out which region you can actually defend and who your project
is really for. Argue about it. That argument is the work.

What you end up with is what you'll read to the room at the end of the session,
and it's the first thing a judge will push on Monday.

When you're happy with it:

```
Save it to wiki/problem-statement.md and commit.
```

Then read it out loud one more time. If any team member can't defend a sentence
in it, that sentence needs a better source. Merge it.

## 8. If you finish early

```
Find contradictions and gaps in our wiki, and tell us what we're missing.
```

## How the team works

Start together, split up, then finish together. The interview in step 1 and the
synthesis in step 5 run once, with one driver. Everything in between happens in
parallel: each of you gets your own draft branch, which is what lets four
people work at the same time without overwriting each other.

Merge the PRs one at a time when you regroup.

## Before you leave

- Your work is **merged to `main`** and you can see it on GitHub
- `wiki/problem-statement.md` exists, with at least two citations
- A region you picked on purpose and can defend out loud
- No uncited claims in anything you plan to pitch
