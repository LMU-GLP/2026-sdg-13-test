# Session 2: build the prototype

Friday, 90 minutes. You're turning evidence into something a judge can open on
their phone.

[Back to the front page](README.md) · [Session 1](session-1.md)

By 12:15 your team has a problem statement you can defend, something live at a
public URL, and a pitch you've said out loud once.

## How today works

**One person drives.** One laptop sends the prompts. The driver is the slowest
part of this team, and the decisions are what matter, so those belong to
everybody:

- **Driver** — types, and reads what Claude did back to the team
- **Everyone** — answers the interviews out loud, argues, decides
- **One reader** — opens the repo on GitHub on their own laptop and reads what
  actually landed, while the driver keeps working
- **One timekeeper** — the clock below is real

## Open it

1. Go to **[claude.ai/code](https://claude.ai/code)** and sign in with your Claude
   account
2. **Check the network setting first.** Above the message box there's a cloud
   button. It should already say **Full network access**. If it says anything
   else, click it and change it. Claude cannot read a single web page without
   this, and it fails quietly: searches come back, then nothing loads
3. Click **+ Select repo...**
4. In the dropdown that opens, click **Connect to GitHub**
5. GitHub asks whether Claude can access your account. Press the green
   **Authorize** button
6. Back in the repo list, search for `2026-sdg-13-test` and click
   **LMU-GLP/2026-sdg-13-test**

**Repo not in the list?** You haven't accepted the invitation to it yet. Open
**[github.com/LMU-GLP/2026-sdg-13-test/invitations](https://github.com/LMU-GLP/2026-sdg-13-test/invitations)**
and press **Accept invitation**. Then reload Claude Code and go back to step 3.


Only the driver needs to do this. Everyone else can read the repo straight from
[github.com/LMU-GLP/2026-sdg-13-test](https://github.com/LMU-GLP/2026-sdg-13-test).

## Your clock

| | |
|---|---|
| 10:55 | Build the wiki |
| 11:05 | **Read it** |
| 11:10 | Write the problem statement |
| 11:20 | **Read it out loud** |
| 11:25 | Design the solution |
| 11:35 | Plan, build, verify |
| 12:05 | Deploy |
| 12:10 | Show it |

## 1. Build the wiki, in one shot (10 min)

Two sources are already in `sources/`, one on each region. **Read them before
you send anything** — they're the only evidence you have right now:

- [Los Angeles](sources/la-extreme-heat.md)
- [South Korea](sources/korea-heat-deaths-elderly.md)

This prompt reads them, finds three more, and builds the wiki from everything
in `sources/`.

```
Set up this repo as an LLM wiki for our challenge:
"How might we help a neighborhood stay safe during extreme heat?"

Read this gist first. It's the pattern we're using, and it explains how the
whole thing should be structured:
https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f

Then start from the two sources already in sources/ and read them both. Find
three more: the UN targets for our goal at
https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal13, one dataset with real figures, and one
program or business already working on this problem. Save each new one as its
own file in sources/, in the same format as the two that are there: page title,
URL, today's date, key figures with short direct quotes, and a two-sentence
summary.

Now build the wiki in wiki/ from all sources, following the structure the
gist describes. Every claim has to cite the source file it came from. Include
one page comparing Los Angeles and South Korea, because we haven't picked a
region yet.

Also write wiki/index.md, listing every page with a link and a one-line
summary, so we know where to start reading.

When you're done, tell us what you found and what surprised you.
```

Watch it work. It searches, opens pages, then writes files. Those actions are
where your citations come from.

Then save it, and publish it so the rest of the team can actually see it:

```
Commit our work with a note about what we did, and push it.
```

Now publish it. Claude saved to a **draft branch**, the driver's own private
copy. Nobody else can see it and none of it counts yet.

**In Claude Code:** just above the message box there's a bar with your branch
name and a green count like `+482 -0`. Click it to see everything Claude
changed, then select **Create PR**.

A **pull request**, or PR, is GitHub's word for a proposal: here are my changes,
should we add them to the team's real work? At a company a teammate reviews it
first. Today your team is the reviewer.

**Then on GitHub:** Claude gives you a link to the PR. Open it, press **Merge
pull request**, then **Confirm merge**. Lost the link? Go to
[your repo](https://github.com/LMU-GLP/2026-sdg-13-test) and click the
**Pull requests** tab.

There is no merge button inside Claude Code. Creating the PR only proposes the
change. Merging is what puts it on `main`.

Don't skip this. Until you merge, the wiki exists only on the driver's private
branch, and the next step asks everyone else to read it.

**You can add more sources later, any time today.** If you spot a gap, or a
judge-proof number you wish you had, just ask for it:

```
Find a source on [what you want] and save it to sources/ in the same format as
the ones already there.
```

A new file in `sources/` changes nothing on its own, though. The wiki is what
your page and your pitch get built from, so every time you add a source, follow
it with:

```
Ingest everything in sources/ and update the wiki.
```

Then commit and merge again.

## 2. Read what you built (5 min)

**Stop typing.** Everyone opens the wiki on their own laptop:

**[github.com/LMU-GLP/2026-sdg-13-test/tree/main/wiki](https://github.com/LMU-GLP/2026-sdg-13-test/tree/main/wiki)**

**Start with `index.md`.** It lists every page with a one-line summary, so read
that first, then open the two or three pages that sound most important. Don't
try to read all of them in five minutes.

Empty, or a 404? You haven't merged. Go back and merge, then reload.

This is the step teams skip, and it's the one that decides whether Monday goes
well. Four questions, out loud:

- Which region has more evidence behind it, LA or South Korea?
- Which number is the most surprising?
- Which claim has no citation under it? That's a placeholder, not evidence
- What does the wiki say that you didn't already believe?

If everything in the wiki is something you already assumed, Claude told you what
you wanted to hear and you should push back on it.

## 3. Write the problem statement (10 min)

Everyone answers, out loud. Claude asks, you decide.

```
Interview us until we have a problem statement we can defend. Ask one question
at a time and give us multiple-choice options.

We need to end up with: the region we're committing to, who specifically is
affected, how many of them, and what our sources actually say about them. Use
everything in sources/ and wiki/, and tell us when our answers contradict our
own evidence.

Don't write it until we've answered. Then save it to
wiki/problem-statement.md, with a citation on every figure, and commit.
```

Argue about this. The region is a real choice and you have evidence for both.

## 4. Read the problem statement out loud (5 min)

**Stop typing again.** One person reads it aloud, slowly, to the team.

Then, honestly: **can every single one of you defend every sentence?** If
anyone hesitates on a sentence, that sentence needs a better source or it needs
to go.

```
Here's what we're unsure about: [say what]. Find a source that settles it, or
tell us the claim isn't supported and cut it.
```

This is the paragraph a judge attacks first on Monday. Five minutes now is
cheaper than freezing in front of them.

## 5. Design the solution (10 min)

Now, and only now, the solution. You couldn't have done this first — you didn't
know whose problem you were solving.

```
Now interview us about our solution to that problem statement.

It could be a business, a program, a service, a product, a campaign, or
something we haven't thought of yet. Don't assume which one.

Ask one question at a time with multiple-choice options, and keep going until
you know who it's for, what it actually does, how it would work in the real
world, and what we're deliberately leaving out. Push back when our idea doesn't
match the problem statement we just wrote.

Then save it to wiki/concept.md and commit.
```

Talk, don't type. Use your laptop's dictation. Spoken answers are longer and
better than anything the driver would type in 30 seconds, and the whole team
hears the ask.

## 6. Plan, then cut it (5 min)

```
Write a short plan for building a page that shows our concept to someone who
has never heard of it. List the steps in order. Keep it to what we can finish
in 25 minutes.
```

Read the plan out loud and cut anything you can't finish. Scoping is the lesson
here. A small thing that works beats a big thing that doesn't.

## 7. Build it (25 min)

Now make your solution come to life. Tell Claude what you decided and let it
build.

**What you build is up to you.** Some options, none of them required:

- **A web app** — if your solution is a product, build the actual thing
- **A website for your business** — the real site, not a picture of one
- **A sign-up page for your program** — how somebody would genuinely join
- **A dashboard** — your evidence, laid out so the problem is impossible to
  ignore
- **Something else entirely** — if you can describe it, Claude can probably
  build it. Ask

One technical rule: it has to be `index.html` in the root of this repo, because
that's the file GitHub Pages publishes.

```
Build it as index.html in the root of this repo so GitHub Pages can serve it.
Use real figures from our sources and put the citation next to each number on
the page. No invented statistics.
```

Then keep going. If the first version is dull, say so and ask for better. Ask
for a chart. Ask it to work on a phone. You have 25 minutes and Claude is fast,
so the limit is what you ask for, not what it can do.

## 8. Verify (5 min)

Never let Claude tell you it's done. Make it show you.

```
Show me it works. Open the page, check every link, and check every number on
it against the file in sources/ it came from. Tell me what's broken or
uncited. Don't tell me it should work.
```

Fix whatever it finds.

## 9. Deploy (5 min)

Save, then merge to `main`, and your page goes live here:

**https://lmu-glp.github.io/2026-sdg-13-test/**

Give it a minute. Open it on your phone. If a judge can't open it Monday, it
doesn't count.

## 10. Say it out loud (5 min)

Ninety seconds, timed, to another team. They ask you one question afterward.

```
Write a 90-second pitch script from our problem statement and our concept.
Plain spoken language, not a summary. Open with the problem and the number
that proves it, name who it's for, say what our solution actually is, point at
what we built, and end with what we want. Save it to wiki/pitch.md and commit.
```

You'll polish delivery Saturday at the pitch workshop. Today just proves the
script exists and fits in 90 seconds.

## Saving and merging, any time

You never type git commands. To save:

```
Commit our work with a note about what we did, and push it.
```

To publish, two clicks in two different places:

- **In Claude Code:** the bar above the message box showing your branch name and
  a green count like `+482 -0` → **Create PR**
- **Then on GitHub:** open the PR link Claude gives you → **Merge pull request**
  → **Confirm merge**

There is no merge button inside Claude Code. Lost the link? Go to
[your repo](https://github.com/LMU-GLP/2026-sdg-13-test) → **Pull requests** tab.


## Before you leave

- Your page is **live** at the URL above and opens on a phone
- `wiki/problem-statement.md`, `wiki/concept.md` and `wiki/pitch.md` are merged
  to `main`
- Every number on the page traces to a file in `sources/`
- At least five sources, all cited in the wiki
- A punch list with a name on each task, for Saturday 9:00-10:30 AM, Sunday
  5:15-10:00 PM, and Monday 9:00-10:00 AM
